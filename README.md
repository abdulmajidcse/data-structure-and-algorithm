# Data Structure and Algorithm

This repository contains exercises and examples for learning Data structure and algorithm.

## Getting Started

You may follow instructions, if you want to run code using docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of command line interface

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abdulmajidcse/data-structure-and-algorithm
   cd data-structure-and-algorithm
   ```

2. Run this command to build image and container or if you have any changes:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. You may run this command when you need to execute your code and then you see a linux based terminal.

   ```sh
   docker-compose run --rm dsa
   ```

4. You may run a PHP file.
